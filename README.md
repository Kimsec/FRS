# Face Recognition Software
tested and working on Raspberry Pi 4b 8GB with python 3.7

## Future

- My long term idea ## was ## to get this working with 3D Scanning (such as FaceID) technology and implement it in door locks and start selling Door locks with fingerprint, PIN and Face Recognition. 


### Requirements:

- Python 3.7
- face-recognition 1.3.0
- face-recognition-models 0.3.0
